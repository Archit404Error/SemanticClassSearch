Focus is on physical and vocal exercises, improvisation, and text and character. There is required play reading, play attendance, and some scene study.\n",
      "72.92193603515625 Learn the alignment foundations of yoga while building strength, flexibility, and vitality! This class is for those who are new to yoga or those looking to fine tune their practice. Students will learn the \"ins and outs\" of a variety of standing poses, back bends, and maybe even a few inversions or arm balances! Modifications will be given to accommodate all levels. Each class will also include breath instruction and poses for stress reduction.\n",
      "65.4964828491211 Generative models are a class of machine learning algorithms that define probability distributions over complex, high-dimensional objects such as images, sequences, and graphs. Recent advances in deep neural networks and optimization algorithms have significantly enhanced the capabilities of these models and renewed research interest in them. This course explores the foundational probabilistic principles of deep generative models, their learning algorithms, and popular model families, which include variational autoencoders, generative adversarial networks, autoregressive models, and normalizing flows. The course also covers applications in domains such as computer vision, natural language processing, and biomedicine, and draws connections to the field of reinforcement learning.\n"
