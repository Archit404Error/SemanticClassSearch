They will learn to relate their images to other images which they have made, as well as to contemporary and historical images. The class includes technical lessons and aesthetic explorations. The class will advance via frequent group critiques. This class is for students who are excited about using photography as a creative and inquiring medium, and concurrently gaining technical knowledge to make this happen.\n",
      "Photography: Intro Photography (ART 2601)\n",
      "This course explores camera and lens as devices that frame and translate three-dimensional space to a two-dimensional surface. Through assignments and individual investigation, students acquire a deeper understanding of visual perception and photography as medium for personal expression. This course introduces students to photographic processes and assumes no prior knowledge of photography.\n",
      "Intro to Photography in Rome (ART 1602)\n",
      "Drawing on Rome's historic and contemporary resources for inspiration, this course introduces photography as a means to visual interpretation and authorship. It addresses concepts essential to lens based artistic practice, as well as the technical foundations of digital photography. In this course students learn about diverse approaches to image making with the camera, and develop a body of work referencing their Rome experience. The course includes lectures, critiques, studio assignments, and visits to museums, galleries, and photography studios.\n",
      "The Art and Science of Birds (UNILWYL 1130)\n",
      "Art and science have always been fundamentally linked. Before the invention of photography, illustration was the main documentation tool in science; even now, artistic representations are used to communicate important scientific discoveries. In this course students learn the basics of bird anatomy in tandem with sketching techniques to foster an appreciation of how science and art can reinforce each other in enriching one's life and study. Led by the staff biological illustrator at the Cornell Lab of Ornithology, students begin with the fundamentals of observational drawing to improve accuracy before moving onto watercolors. Interwoven into art lessons are scientific lectures produced by Cornell ornithologists, blending art with current science to cover a range of interconnected topics. No prior bird knowledge or art experience is required or expected.\n",

      "FWS: Can Art Change the World? (ARTH 1176)\n",
      " bell hooks wrote that \"Changing how we see images is clearly one way to change the world.\" But how do images, in turn, shape how we perceive the world around us? How does art and visual culture contribute to historical change? This course examines how images can construct, or question, our perspectives. We will think critically about what separates the everyday images we consume through advertisements and social media from the fine art of modern and contemporary art institutions. Drawing on a selection of modern and contemporary artists working in various geopolitical contexts, students will learn how to pair art historical methods of describing images with political, economic, and social analysis. The course will also introduce students to key texts and theories for developing a critical writing practice, particularly from the Marxist, post-/de-colonial, and Black radical traditions.\n",
      "FWS: Reading Films (COML 1104)\n",
      "We live in an image-saturated world. How do we make sense of the moving image and its powerful roles in shaping culture and mediating our relationship with the world? This course will equip students with the tools to understand and decipher film language. It introduces and interrogates the basic notions, technologies, terminologies, and theories of film analysis. We will study visual and compositional elements, like mise-en-scène, cinematography, editing, and sound. Films we discuss will include different geographies, genres, major directors, schools, and film movements. Through writing, students will learn to analyze films with accurate, medium-specific vocabulary, develop informed and nuanced arguments, and critically reflect on the position of the viewer.\n",
      "Art and Remapping of the World (SHUM 6680)\n",
      "What possibilities does art offer to challenge the primacy of mapping in visualizing our world? Maps allow us to move through space, but they do so by abstracting space to its barest aspects—an act of reduction that has historically served to eliminate Indigenous inhabitants, ecological entanglements, non-spatial elements, and countless other features of our lived environment. This course posits remapping as an act of repair, a means of correcting some of the reductive tendencies of maps. Moving between the history of cartography, particularly as it appears in Cornell's extensive Map Collection, and a study of artistic critiques of the map, we will develop a critical vocabulary for assessing cartographic practice and explore new tools for imagining it otherwise. For longer description and instructor bio visit the Society for the Humanities website.\n",
