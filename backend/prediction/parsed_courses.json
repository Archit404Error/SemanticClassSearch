Gender was at play in Jewish negotiation of social class, racial status, ethnic status, and even citizenship. In different societies, Jews used gendered religion, and religious gender, to achieve assimilation, or to protect against it. Judaism also contains a strongly gendered tradition of texts and practices, and this tradition pulls Jewish gender in its own directions.
